	<strong>About</strong>

	This application illustrates the geographical relationships and
	chronological relationships of the exhibited objects. It was
	developed by a student team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
	The ultimate goal of the project is to enhance visitor experience 
	at Worcester Art Museum. The project began in November 2013 and 
	concluded in April 2014. <br> <br>
