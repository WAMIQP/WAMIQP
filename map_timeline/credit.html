	<strong>About</strong><br> 
	This web-based application illustrates the geographical relationships 
	and chronological relationships of the exhibited objects. It was 
	developed by an Interactive Qualifying Project team from Worcester 
	Polytechnic Institute. The ultimate goal of the project is to enhance 
	visitor experience with the Armory Collection at Worcester Art Museum. 
	The project kicked off in November 2013, and concluded in April 2014.
