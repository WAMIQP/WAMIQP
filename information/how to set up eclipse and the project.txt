How to set up the program/work environment (eclipse)
1. Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE (32 bits or 64 bits are fine. If you're unsure, pick 32 bits)
2. Unzip the file, put the eclipse folder somewhere you'll remember.
3. Create a shortcut to desktop, if you want to.
4. Open eclipse.exe (the one with purple circle icon)
5. If it's your first time, Eclipse will ask for the workspace, pick a folder you want your work to be.
6. On the top menu, click help -> eclipse marketplace
7. Search for "EGit" and enter
8. You'll see "EGit - Git Team Provider". Click install
9. Click next, next, confirm, accept agreement, next, next, etc.
10. Restart Eclipse

Set up the project in Eclipse
1. Click File -> import
2. Find git -> project from Git (alternatively you can search for git). Click next.
3. Click clone URI, then next.
4. Fill in the following:
	URI: https://github.com/WAMIQP/WAMIQP
	User: WAMIQP
	Password: wamiqp2014
	Store in Secure store: yes...? (I believe this is like "remember me" thing.)
5. Click next
6. Set the directory to be any directory you want. I recommend using a folder in your own computer, not your school drive/folder)
7. Make sure "import existing project" is checked, click next
8. Make sure WAMIQP is checked, then finish.
